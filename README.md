In this assignment we had to use react, redux, and routing to create a basic blog system. We had to make several different views for the different pages on the blog. We also had to make api calls to create, update, and delete using the api provided for us.

Overall I was able to get everything to work. I had an issue while I was working in that I forgot to create an ActionType for one of my api calls, so the screen was not updating correctly, but was able to fix that.

I didn't do much extra credit, I only made part of it look a little bit nicer.
